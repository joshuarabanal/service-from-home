<page title="Different from Traditional Call Centers" background="#61636d" text-color="black">
  <p>
    In traditional call centers, you are in a crowded, noisy, room with people who are not the most friendly. and your managers are constantly bothering you and talking to you while you speak to customers. This creates an stressful environment for all of the employess. This is the reason why most people quit their jobs at a call center. It is not due to the customers that they speak to, but the added stress the work environment creates.
